Homework #4 from Compilers Design course. Given a Context Free grammar program a syntax recognizer implementing a symbols table using Bison, Yacc, Flex and C.

## Compile

To **compile**, just type the _make_ command in the bash.

```bash
make
```

If it is **not possible**, enter the next instructions in the bash:

```bash
lex -l recognizer.l
bison -dv parser.y
gcc -o parser parser.tab.c lex.yy.c -lfl
```

## Execute

To **run** tests, type _make *<TEST_NUMBER>*_ in the bash.

* TEST_NUMBER = {one, two, three, four,  ... , eight}

 Example:

```bash
make one
```

If it is **not possible**, enter the next instructions in the bash:

```bash
./parser < tests/_<TEST_NUMBER>_.txt
```
